# Flight_Prediction_project
mplemented a flight prediction system using two algorithms, Linear Regression and Decision Trees, to forecast flight prices accurately. The project involved preprocessing and analyzing flight data to extract relevant features such as departure time, destination, and airline. Utilized the Linear Regression algorithm
